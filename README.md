Star Tours Booking & Vacations application
The Star Tours Booking & Vacations app is designed as a way to search for planets and add yourself to a flight to that destination.

How to use
To add Planet Info to the selection area, simply click on the add planets button within the card. To remove a planet simply click the Remove Planets button from the added card. The initial thought is to create a fun and flavorful way to learn about worlds within the Star Wars universe.

The search bar allows a few features:

Search for a specific Planet: Use that planets name

Search for planets that start with a specific letter: Search just that letter

After a search if you want to bring all the Planet Info back into view, simply submit an empty search and they will all reappear!

My API was found online here is its main page: https://swapi.dev/api
Code for the animated background featured on the webpage was found here: author Ashikpaul on cssscript.com and a direct link: (https://www.cssscript.com/animated-starfield-effect/)
This was the baseline code used as a jumping off point to customize and implement my own starfield effect. You will notice a few differences between my own code and the cited code as it was edited to fit my needs.

Project Status
This is the End of Phase 1 project for Flatirons School. For now there will be minor updates. There may be a portion of time before I come back and continue adding additional features such as a filter function.
