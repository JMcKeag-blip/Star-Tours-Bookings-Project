        <h3>Welcome to your next out ofthis world vacation</h3>
        <p>
            Welcome to Star Tours! Our world class operating system will allow you to filter planets in the galaxy
            by many different features, such as Climate, Terrain, Population size, and even alphabetically if you
            know what planet you are looking for as your next vacation destination! Simply filter for planets based
            on your ideal destination and watch the results flood in. Once you know where you would like to fly to,
            click on the planet, then press the "Book Flight" button and our reservations system will put you in
            the queue. Our website should show you an increased bookings number when you click the button. Now you
            are all set for your next vacation amongst the stars!
